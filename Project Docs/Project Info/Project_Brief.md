## üéØ **Project Vision & Purpose**

### **What We're Building**
Pro Clubs is the definitive community management platform for FIFA/EA Sports FC Pro Clubs - a comprehensive ecosystem that transforms how virtual football communities track players, manage clubs, analyze performance, and engage with each other.

### **Core Mission**
To create the most advanced, user-friendly, and feature-rich platform for Pro Clubs enthusiasts that seamlessly integrates with EA Sports game data while fostering a thriving competitive community.
